# Sudoku_solver
A simple Sudoku solver built in C++ using the backtracking algorithm. The program reads a Sudoku grid and automatically fills in missing cells while ensuring row, column, and 3Ã—3 subgrid validity.
# Highlights
* Demonstrates recursion, backtracking, and grid validation logic.
* Strengthened understanding of algorithm design and optimization.
* Implemented formatted console output for user-friendly grid display.
# Technologies:
C++, Console I/O, Algorithm Design
