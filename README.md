# Sudoku Solver
A console-based game built in C++, featuring a predefined Sudoku puzzle that gets solved automatically using the backtracking Algorithm.

# Project Overview
This program contains an in-built Sudoku puzzle stored in a 9Ã—9 2D array.  
It prints the unsolved Sudoku grid, solves it step by step using recursion and backtracking,  
and then displays the completed grid neatly formatted in the console.

# Technologies Used
- C++
- 2D Arrays
- Recursion
- Backtracking Algorithm
- Control Structures

# How It Works
1. The Sudoku puzzle is already defined in the code.  
2. The program prints the original unsolved grid.  
3. It then recursively tries numbers (1â€“9) in each empty cell ("0" means empty).  
4. When a valid configuration is found, it continues until the puzzle is fully solved.
